  <h1>Contracting</h1>

  <p>My domain expertise is in property-based testing, fuzzing, and combining those with AI; see for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09907">the NeurIPS workshop paper</a> I co-authored with Anthropic.</p>

  <p>Starting in the latter half of 2025, I've contracted at <a href="https://quansight.com/">Quansight</a>, where I worked to support thread-safety in both <a href="https://github.com/hypothesisWorks/hypothesis/">Hypothesis</a> (<a href="https://hypothesis.works/articles/thread-safe/">see</a>) and more recently in <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest">pytest</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/13768">see</a>). In February–April 2025, I contracted with <a href="https://metr.org/">METR</a> as a participant in their widely-cited <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">study on AI productivity</a>.</p>
