# [tybug.github.io](https://tybug.github.io/)

My personal blog / website. Don't expect a lot of posts; I only write about things I find interesting. Usually either python or mathematics related.

## Development

To install dependencies:

```
gem install bundler
bundler install
```

To serve locally (on <http://127.0.0.1:4000/>):

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To deploy, just push. Github pages takes care of the rest.
