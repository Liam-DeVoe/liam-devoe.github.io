My personal blog / website. Don't expect a lot of posts; I only write about things I find interesting. Usually either python or mathematics related.

## Development

To install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To serve locally (on <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>):

```bash
pelican --listen
```

To deploy, just push. GitHub Actions takes care of the rest.
