# [tybug.github.io](https://tybug.github.io/)

Personal blog, for now. Not sure where I'll take it in the future. Don't expect a lot of posts; I only write about things I find interesting. Usually python related, but likely mathematics in the future as well.

## Development

To serve locally (<http://127.0.0.1:4000/>):

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To deploy, just push. Github pages takes care of the rest.
